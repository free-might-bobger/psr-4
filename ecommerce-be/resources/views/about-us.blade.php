                                <p>We train students the non-traditional way with the use of community classrooms, industry partners, on-the-job training and many more. Among the requirements for graduation are mock interviews and career panels. Needless to say, all students go through rigorous training in the preparation of portfolio and letters of introduction/application. We are proud to say that not so many graduates have these opportunities before graduation.</p>
                                <p>It is our hope that you will send your youth to IIT to learn and be trained to be responsible professionals and constituents. We are proud to be the skills academy. "Your new career starts here!"</p>
